# p5-typescript-starter

A bare-bones boilerplate for [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) with [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) & [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

## Installation

Create your own repo using this one as a template ([how?](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)), clone it, install dependencies and you are set.

```shell
npm i
```

## Development

```shell
npm start
```

## Building

```shell
npm run build
```

## Note

This boilerplate uses p5@**0.7.2** to match TypeScript typings. Feel free to open an issue or create a PR if you noticed that versions of p5 and/or @types used in this repo are severely outdated. :)
